# What's the deal?
if you divide the ellipse into 3 parts by two parallel lines, leaving two equal parts and one "filling" between them. Is it possible to make a circle out of those two equal parts?

The two identical parts must be said to have identical or close together radii r1 and r2, or distances from O (the optimally chosen point).
